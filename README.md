# Film Search

## Description
The Film Search project is a web application that allows a user to search for a film and recieve back information about the film, alongside the film poster and YouTube trailer. This is achieved by using the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com "OMDB API Website") & [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3 "YouTube Data API Website"). The search history is shown below the search results so that the user can easily return to previous searches. Search history is stored on the users local storage.



## Usage
Visit the [Film Search Website](https://sophieldavis.github.io/film-search "Film Search Website") to try it.

To use the Film Search you can simply input the name of a film, and the web page will display the results.
